In 2015 , physician density was 0.05 per 1,000 people , far below the average forlow - income countries ( LICs ) ( 0.325).9 Similarly , the density of nurses and midwives was much lower than theaverage of Sub - Saharan African countries ( 0.3 per 1,000 people and 1.029 per 1,000 people , respectively ) .

It is one of the first economic analyzes of the restoration actions completed under the ROAM framework.14.Specifically , these economic values were obtained from different agricultural products of El Salvador , considering their characteristic benefits and costs . The social annual flows ( which include both , social and private returns ) for all the economic activities assessed are taken from Raes et al .

The values for basic grains , gallery forests and sugar cane production activities do not show a significant change in the eleven - year period of the study ; however , they could present an increase of the benefits in a much longer period.98Raes , L. , Nello , T.

Modified but similar documents ( MOU and Geothermal Development Agreement ( GDA ) ) were signed again in 2010 , replacing the 2004 arrangements . UNEC , a small company , never took concrete actions to develop the geothermal resource . In 2014 , UNEC brought Ormat , an international geothermal energy developer , into discussions with the GoSL to negotiate a Rights Transfer Agreement ( RTA ) among UNEC , Ormat and the GoSL . However , these negotiations were unsuccessful . From February 2020 to March 2021 , the GoSL attempted to engage UNEC regarding its intention to develop the geothermal resource ; however , UNEC was unresponsive . Given the lack of any action by UNEC under the signed agreement and the continued unresponsiveness despite various attempts at outreach by the GoSL , in April 2021 the GoSL terminated the 2010 MOU and GDA .\n",

Therefore , the seismic hazard used in the economic and financial analysis in this annex is defined in terms of site - dependent ground motion parameters ( PGA ) . The CBA presented below is based on a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis , which assumes two scenario earthquakes : a. EQ scenario 1 : PGA values occurring on the Project sites with 63 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years , and collectively corresponding to a 50 - year MRP . The PGA values with a 50 - year MRP have a probability ofexceedance of 18 percent in 10 years , of 33 percent in 20 years , of 45 percent in 30 years , or of 63 percent in50 years . In terms of moment magnitude of an earthquake generated by Vrancea intermediate - depth seismicsource , the mean recurrence interval of 50 years corresponds to MW = 7.2.b . EQ scenario 2 : PGA values occurring on Project sites with 39 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years , and collectively corresponding to a 100 - year MRP . The PGA values with a 100 - year MRP have a probability ofexceedance of 9.5 percent in 10 years , of 18.1 percent in 20 years , of 25.9 percent in 30 years , or of 39 percentin 50 years .

      "21.For all 92 school buildings , a P2 renovation package will lead to annual energy savings of EUR 0.816 million , while an nZEB package will lead to EUR 1.1575 million savings . For the P2 case , this will lead to 24.2 kg / m2 / year in CO2 reduction ( 2,683 toe / year , or 80,5 thousands metric tons for 30 years ) ; for the nZEB case , the figure is 41 kg / m2 / year CO2 reduction ( 4,574 toe / year , or 137.2 thousands metric tons for 30 years ) . The shadow price of carbon was taken at US$ 40 per toe at a 3 percent increase over each year . This was estimated considering a reduction of 45–77 percent of the CO2 emissions from the value of the reference building emission ( 52.5 kg CO2 / m2 / year for gas boiler case and 56.1 kg CO2 / m2 / year for district heating case).Table A8.3 .

Using the 2013–2014 household survey to estimate the share of the NEET youthpopulation , it is estimated that about 6 percent ( exactly 5.62 percent ) of youth ages 15–24 were NEET . Assuming that thisshare remains the same over the lifetime of the project , and using the UNDP population projection to estimate the NEETpopulation , the stock of the NEET population in 2021 is estimated to be 142,172 with an average annual flow of 5,509 .\n",

Poverty estimates use the upper - middle income international povertyline ( US$ 5.50 - a - day in 2011 Purchase Power Parity ) and , unlike the World Bank Macro - Poverty Outlook , are based onmicrosimulations using the harmonized Socio - Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean ( SEDLAC ) . Baseline datafor all projections is from 2014 . Assessing more recent changes in poverty and inequality is difficult , due to the scarceavailability of socio - economic data ( since 2000 , Guatemala has had the second - lowest number of household surveys available inthe region , only after Haiti).4 Data from the latest available household survey ( ENCOVI).5 According to the 2018 census , the Indigenous Peoples of Guatemala ( of Mayan , Xinca or Garífuna descent ) represent 44 percentof Guatemala 's population . Eighty percent live in poverty compared to 47 percent of the non - indigenous population . The Garífunaare a culturally distinct Afro - descendant group recognized as an \" ethnic group \" and represent about 1 percent of the Guatemalanpopulation.6 Guatemala Population Census , 2018.7 United Nations Development Program ( UNDP ) . 2020 .
